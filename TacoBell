I really want some taco bell
I drove there and waited in line
I ordered a Beefy Melt Burrito
and a mexican Pizza
and a cheesy gordita crunch
with a baja blast
I thought I was done ordering but I had so much more i wanted to get
I got 2 chalupa supremes
3 crunchwrap supremes
4 Doritos Locos Tacos
and 5 cinnamon twists
